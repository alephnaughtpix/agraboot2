                               * AGRABOOT 2 *
                                ------------

               PROBABLY THE BEST ANTIVIRUS IN THE WORLD!!!

Hell, I feel good now. I've just coded the best goddamn antivirus bootsector
there ever was, and I've tested it and it works!!! I have tested it on 4 meg
machines now, so it's avoided the sort of error that cropped up in the Medway
Boys Protector 3!


* What should be in this archive *

        AGRABOOT.PRG            The installer program
        AGRABOOT.DOC            You're reading this!

Don't spread AGRABOOT 2 without this DOC file please! This program is Public
Domain- please spread it as widely as possible!

I'm still not too sure if it's Falcon compatible, though!


* What AGRABOOT 2 does *

The problem of bootsector viruses is pretty widespread, especially amongst
people who swap PD and shareware programs, often without checking their disks
for viruses. (Thankfully most PD Libraries and bulletin board systems are
more careful.) Viruses can range from the kind that can ruin valuable data,
such as Kobald virus, to just plain annoying, like the Ghost virus. More ways
are being sought to stop the spread of this problem.

Basically a bootsector virus is a program hidden in the bootsector which stays
in memory and writes itself to the bootsector of another disk when it is
accessed. A bootsector can be executable for many reasons, for example to
load a game or a demo, so if a disk bootsector is seen to be executable, it
might NOT necessarily be a virus. It is NOT advisable to try and immunise a
disk such as a games disk or demo disk, as you might not be able to load it!

You might already be familiar with the concept of an antivirus bootsector.
This is basically a small program installed in the bootsector, in a similar
way to a virus, but does not spread like a virus. It might display a message
such as 'This disk is virus free!' at startup. This will by itself stop many
viruses, as many of them don't write to already executable bootsectors.
However there are unfortunately some viruses (Such as the 'B' strain of Ghost
virus) which overwrite ANY bootsector, whether it's a simple blank disk, or
your favourite game. So, as a result, other more complex antivirus
bootsectors have been coded.

Some test for viruses in memory. There are viruses (such as Ghost) that have
been programmed to stay in memory after a reset and re-activate before
booting. They can either use 'reset vector' or 'reset resident' code. As a
result, bootsectors like the Medway Boys Protectors, which check for such
code, have been coded. There is also another type of antivirus bootsector
which stays in memory like a virus and flashes the screen when a disk with
an executable bootsector is accessed.

AGRABOOT 2 does both and more!


* AGRABOOT 2 features- all in 512 bytes! *

AGRABOOT 1 was based a bit on the testing routine of the old 'English
Antivrus', but was mostly coded by myself. It also included the unique feature
of flashing in red at suspicious looking executable bootsectors!!!

AGRABOOT 2 continues this feature, but also features an improved testing
routine for reset-resident programs!!! If there is a reset-resident program
in memory, you are given the opportunity of clearing it from memory. This
means that my antivirus bootsector is effectively immune to Ghost at last!

I might as well explain my reasoning about flashing at bootsectors. Most
antivirus bootsectors are either of the type that will check for reset
programs or flash at a bootsector if it's executable. (Mine does both!) But
now you have a situation where every PD disk has an antivirus bootsector, or
a DMA loader, which means that the normal sort of flashing antivirus will
flash at well nigh every disk you choose to put in your drive!!!!

My antivirus will flash at executable bootsectors, but will flash RED at very
suspicious bootsectors which which are almost certainly viruses. Please note
that this is not a foolproof system. For example, Fun and Oli virus will not
register as suspicious, but WILL flash the screen anyway. However, most
viruses I have tested will show up.


* Installing AGRABOOT 2 *

This is really quite simple. You just run AGRABOOT.PRG, and insert the disk
you wish to install the AGRABOOT 2 bootsector on. Again, don't do this with
a game or a demo disk! You are given the choice of either installing AGRABOOT
2 on a disk (key A) or making a clean non-excutable sector (key C).


* Any suggestions? *

Possible improvements for AGRABOOT 3!
1) Shorten the flashing time. (Suggested by Wheee the Fibble)
2) Inbetweeny flash (eg orange for a little bit suspicious!) This would
   catch out Oli and Fun viruses!
3) Compatibility with Mono monitors?

If there are any other suggestions or anything else, contact:

Also I have access to email before 30th June at

                or

        m.james%vme.gla.ac.uk@nsf.ac.uk

I use the second one when I'm send text files to myself from Internet hosts
so if you have trouble getting through, use that one.

Have a nice virus free time.....

Thanks to - the writer of the original 'English Antivirus' ('HN0'?) for the
original inspiration for this boot!
Iain and Peter of Pheonix PDL Glasgow for getting me into writing for
bootsectors in a round about sort of way - ie my idea of putting a bootsector
title for their Phoenix PDL Games Menu (Which I also coded!)
Zuul of ESC - for their virus killer (The best!) - It was the only way (honest)
that I could install Ghost and other virus onto one of disks for testing
Agraboot!!!!
Wheee the Fibble- for 'constructive' criticism.

Greetings go to : Phoenix PDL (long may it reign!!), Axe Man, Wheee the Fibble,
Colin of ACO, Neil of The Gap, Dimension Zero esp Michael Lynn, Network Trash
esp Torg and 6025, Hopeless Lamers esp Deathslayer & Bip (Yes, I will get the
demo finished!!), the soon to be ex-Pres. and ex-SVP of GUSRC, everybody in
GUSNA, and everyone else in the entire multidimensional infinity of all
creation.

A special HI to everybody I met at the Ripped Off party!
