               PROBABLY THE BEST ANTIVIRUS IN THE WORLD!!!

Hell, I feel good now. I've just coded the best goddamn antivirus bootsector
there ever was, and I've tested it and it works!!! I haven't tested it on 4
megs yet, but I've been trying to avoid the sort of error that cropped up in
the Medway Boys Protecter 3, so it SHOULD work.

AGRABOOT 1 was based a bit on the testing routine of the old 'English
Antivrus', but was mostly coded by myself. It also included the unique feature
of flashing in red at suspicious looking executable bootsectors!!!

AGRABOOT 2 continues this feature, but also features an improved testing
routine for reset-resident programs!!! If there is a reset-resident program
in memory, you are given the opportunity of clearing it from memory. This
means that my antivirus bootsector is effectively immune to Ghost at last!

I might as well explain my reasoning about flashing at bootsectors. Most
antivirus bootsectors are either of the type that will check for reset
programs or flash at a bootsector if it's executable. (Mine does both!) But
now you have a situation where every PD disk has an antivirus bootsector, or
a DMA loader, which means that the normal sort of flashing antivirus will
flash at well nigh every disk you choose to put in your drive!!!!

My antivirus will flash at executable bootsectors, but will flash RED at very
suspicious bootsectors which which are almost certainly viruses. Please note
that this is not a foolproof system. For example, Fun and Oli virus will not
register as suspicious. However, most viruses I have tested will show up.

Have a nice virus free time.....

Thanks to - the writer of the original 'English Antivirus' ('HN0'?) for the
original inspiration for this boot!
Iain and Peter of Pheonix PDL Glasgow for getting me into writing for
bootsectors in a round about sort of way - ie my idea of putting a bootsector
title for their Phoenix PDL Games Menu (Which I also coded!)
Zuul of ESC - for their virus killer (The best!) - It was the only way (honest)
that I could install Ghost and other virus onto one of disks for testing
Agraboot!!!!

Greetings go to : Phoenix PDL (long may it reign!!), Axe Man, Wheee the Fibble,
Colin of ACO, Neil of The Gap, Dimension Zero esp Michael Lynn, Network Trash
esp Torg and 6025, Hopeless Lamers esp Deathslayer & Bip (Yes, I will get the
demo finished!!), the soon to be ex-Pres. and ex-SVP of GUSRC, everybody in
